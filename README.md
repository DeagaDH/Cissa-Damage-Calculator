# Cissa-Damage-Calculator

A Damage Calculator for MHWI. I recently started learning Python and thought I'd do this as a personal project.
I'm not too sure that this will be useful for other people but hey, it doesn't cost anything to share!
I hope to get at least all Blademaster weapons implemented sooner rather than later and add some quality
of life functionality soon. I just wanted to get SOMETHING out of the door first!

I'd also like to take this space to thank MoonBunnie#0001 and Deathcream#1576 for their huge datasheets on Iceborne,
which were a huge help in compiling pretty much anything damage related, MechE__ for their hitzone data compilation
and Honey for her armor set builder and damage calculator, which I used to double check my own results.
